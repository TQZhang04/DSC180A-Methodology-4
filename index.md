What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
-
So far, the topic of curriculum learning has been the most interesting. I think the idea behind it is the most cognitively plausible, and I believe there is more to be expanded upon as far as objective curriculums go.

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
--
A potential investigation could be marrying the idea behind objective curriculum and the success of the GPT-BERT model architecture, creating a model that dynamically switches its training objective throughout the course of training in a cognitively-plausible way. I think combinations of curriculum techniques could also boost performance for curriculum models.


What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
--
One change would be spending a considerable amount of time building a testing pipeline first, so that model building is easier later on.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
-
I'm also interested in other variations to architecture, and use of larger language models as teachers to aid smaller models. For example, for certain curriculum tasks, the difficulty of the data is estimated using n-gram models. What if we used an LLM instead?
